# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 
After learning unsupervised learning, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA, now we use these skills by creating an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

For this, we were asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment, we got the data from CryptoCompare, but we work with this data before being processed to fit the machine learning models using unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm and some data visualizations to share in the report.
